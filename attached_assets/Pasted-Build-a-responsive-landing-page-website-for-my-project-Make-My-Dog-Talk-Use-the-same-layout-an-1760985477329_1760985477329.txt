Build a responsive landing page website for my project **Make My Dog Talk**.

Use the same layout and color theme as this pet service Canva template:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/4334016432/pet-services-website-canva-website

🎯 GOAL:
We're building a fun and professional landing page for an AI app where users upload a dog photo + prompt, and it generates a short 6-second talking video of their dog.

We're NOT using any of the dog photos or grooming content from the template — just cloning the structure and styling.

🧱 TECH STACK:
- React + TailwindCSS (or Next.js if you prefer)
- Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Light blue theme (like the Canva template)
- Rounded buttons, soft borders, and clean layout
- Modern sans-serif font (Inter or similar)

---
